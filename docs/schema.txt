DEX online schema documentation
===============================

This documentation is by no means complete. Nor do we promise to keep
it up to date as the schema evolves. However, we try to explain in
general how the data is stored and how the tables are connected.


The Source table
----------------

A Source is essentially a dictionary from which we import
definitions. It has attributes like Name, Author, Publisher and Year.


The Definition table
--------------------

id - Unique numeric ID.
userId - Matches User.id.
sourceId - Matches Source.id.
lexicon - A bit of text extracted from the beginnning of the
  definition. This is usually, though not always, equal to the term
  being defined. It is not used for searching, but only for sorting
  definitions.
displayed - Number of times the definition was displayed.
internalRep - The actual text.
htmlRep - HTML-formatted text, ready for printing in a browser.
status - 0 = active, 1 = temporary (not yet reviewed), 2 = deleted


The Lexem table
----------------

A lexem is essentially a word. Homonyms get separate lexems each.

id - Unique numeric ID.
form - Base form of the word, including an (') for the
  accent. This makes it impractical for searches.
formNoAccent, formUtf8General - These two have equal values,
  obtained from Lexem.form by removing the accent. The fields have
  different collates (utf8_romanian_ci and utf8_general_ci,
  respectively). The former is used for searches including diacritics,
  the latter is used for searches without diacritics, because in
  utf8_general_ci ă = â = a, ș = s and so on.
reverse - the reverse of formNoAccent. Only used in certain
  admin tools where we need suffix matching.
description - Generally used to distinguish among homonyms.
modelType, modelNumber - The declension model for this lexem
restriction - A subset of the letters S (singular), P (plural),
  U (unipersonal), I (impersonal), T (past tenses only). Indicates
  that this lexem only generates a subset of the allowed word forms
  for the lexem's model. To see which restrictions allow which forms,
  use the ConstraintMap table. For example, the verb "a ploua" ("to
  rain") only allows third person singular form, hence the restriction I.
comment - Admins can add comments. All lexems with non-empty
  comments are reported on the admin page and should be reviewed and
  fixed.
isLoc - You can probably ignore this. Indicates whether the
  lexem is included in LOC, the Official Word List accepted by the
  Romanian Scrabble Federation for all its competitions. A few
  moderators can modify this list.
noAccent - If true, indicates that this lexem does not need an
  accent. Otherwise, a report on the admin page shows all the lexems
  for which Lexem.form does not include an accent.


The LexemDefinitionMap table
----------------------------

This links lexems to definitions in a many-to-many relationship. At
the moment, all homonym lexems are connected to all the
definitions. In the long run, we plan to fix the database so that, for
example, "mare" ("sea") and "mare" ("large") are only linked to their
respective definitions.


The Inflection table
---------------------

This is a non-structured list of all the possible inflected forms in
Romanian, for example "Substantiv neutru, Nominativ-Acuzativ, plural,
nearticulat".

modelType - For simplicity, each inflection is only used with one part
  of speech as indicated here.


The InflectedForm table
------------------

This stores all the inflected forms for all the lexems. All these
forms are generated according to the lexem's model type and number.

form - The form, including an (') for the accent
formNoAccent, formUtf8General - Obtained from form by removing
  the apostrophe. Same rationale as for formNoAccent and formUtf8General.
lexemId - Matches Lexem.id
inflectionId - Matches Inflection.id
variant - 0-based counter for situations where multiple forms are
  accepted for the same inflection (e.g. "cântaserăm" / "cântasem",
  both accepted for the past perfect, plural, 1st person).
recommended - true if the form is still in use in current speech.
  This corresponds to ModelDescription.recommended, but is cached
  on every InflectedForm for speed.

EXAMPLE: Here is a SQL query that lists the paradigm for "știucă":

select form, Inflection.description, variant
  from Lexem, InflectedForm, Inflection
  where Lexem.id = lexemId
    and inflectionId = Inflection.id
    and formNoAccent = 'știucă'
  order by Inflection.id;


The ModelType table
---------------------

The model types roughly correspond to parts of speech. One interesting
model type is T (temporary). It indicates that we do not yet have a
paradigm for this lexem. An admin will have to look at it and
establish the correct model type and number. Until then, we do not
display any paradigm for this lexem when the user searches for it.

canonical - Some model types have "dependants". For example A
  (adjective) generates the same set of forms as MF (nouns with both
  masculine and feminine forms, like "constructor"). We only store
  information about A (the canonical model).


The Model table
----------------

This is the core of the inflection generator. The way we generate the
inflected forms of each word is to group words into models. All the
words having the same model are declensed the same way (in terms of
letter transformations). Some models have thousands of words, while
some models only have one word (these are basically exceptions). For
every model we chose an exponent word and we enumerated its inflected
forms explicitly. Then we extracted a set of "transformations" that
transform the base form in each inflected form. To generate the
paradigm of another lexem with the same model, we apply the same
transforms.

EXAMPLE: Model F117 has the exponent c'arte ("book"). The plural of
c'arte is c'ărți ("books"). Hence, the transform list to generate the
plural is

a -> ă
t -> ț
e -> i

Now if we label "p'arte" ("part") with the same model, F117, we can
find its plural form by applying the same transforms. The result is
"p'ărți" ("parts").

flag - Not really used now, we used it while we were building
the database to allow admins to flag models with problems.


The Transform table
--------------------

Transforms are essentially (from -> to) pairs. Each of the three
transforms in the example above has an entry in this table.


The ModelDescription table
---------------------------

For every model, this table lists the acceptable inflections and the
way to generate them

id - Unique numeric ID.
modelId - Matches Model.id.
inflectionId - Matches Inflection.id.
variant - 0-based counter where multiple variants are allowed for
  the same inflectionId. Matches InflectedForm.variant.
applOrder - When multiple letter transformations are necessary to
  obtain the inflected form from the base form, the order in which we
  apply the transforms is important, hence this field (0-based).
isLoc - Whether this (modelId, inflectionId, variant) is accepted in
  LOC. Only meaningful for rows where applOrder = 0;
recommended - true if the resulting inflected form is still in use in
  current speech.
transformId - Matches Transform.id.
accentShift - Indicates where the accent falls in the inflected form:
  100 - Unknown accent shift. We don't know where the accent falls,
    because when we initially enumerated the paradigm for this model,
    either the base form or the inflected form did not include an
    accent.
  101 - No accent shift. The accent falls in the exact same place as
    it did in the base form. This indicates that the base form and the
    inflected form are identical up to, and including, the accented
    vowel.
  other numbers - The accent falls on this vowel, counting from the
    right, 1-based.
vowel - Sometimes, due to morphologic phenomena, the vowel at the
  position indicated by accentShift is not the correct vowel to
  bear accent. So in the model's exponent, the accented vowel may be
  the 3rd from the right, but in other lexems of the same model, the
  accented vowel could be the 4th or 2nd from the right, due mainly to
  diphthongs. If the vowel at position accentShift differs from
  vowel, look one letter to the left or right for vowel and put
  the accent on it.

EXAMPLE: Here is how to find the paradigm for "c'arte", the exponent
for F117:

select exponent, Inflection.description, variant, applOrder,
       accentShift, vowel, transfFrom, transfTo
  from Model, ModelDescription, Inflection, Transform
  where Model.id = modelId
    and transformId = Transform.id
    and inflectionId = Inflection.id
    and Model.ModelType = 'F'
    and Model.number = '117'
  order by inflectionId, variant, applOrder;


The participleModel table
---------------------------

Lexems labeled with the model_type 'VT' are transitive verbs and their
participle form should be declensed as an adjective. For example, "a
speria" (to scare) has the participle "speriat" (scared), which has
the usual adjective forms "speriată", "speriați", "speriate"
etc. Commonly, this adjective is declensed according to the model A2,
but not always. The participleModel indicates, for every verb model,
the corresponding adjective model to be used for participles.

id - Unique numeric ID.
verbModel - The number (not ID!) of the verb model. An entry in
  Model is guaranteed to exist with type V and number verbModel.
adjectiveModel - The number (not ID!) of the adjective model. An
  entry in Model is guaranteed to exist with type A and number
  adjectiveModel.

The Visual table
------------------

Contains information about definition images. Images are stored in 
wwwbase/img/visual folder and every image has a corresponding thumbnail
that is created in a .thumb folder (e.g. wwwbase/img/visual/flower.jpg
-> image => wwwbase/img/visual/.thumb/flower.jpg -> thumbnail).

id - Unique numeric ID.
path - Image path relative to visual folder.
width - Image width.
height - Image height.
lexemeId - The lexeme ID to which the image corresponds.
userId - The ID of the user that has uploaded the image.
revised - A boolean value to show whether the image has been tagged.
          If true, then it is ready for display on the corresponding
          lexeme definition page.


The VisualTag table
---------------------

Contains information needed to draw a tag on the canvas element.
This information is automatically stored from the tagging page.

id - Unique numeric ID.
imageId - The image on which the tags will be drawn.
lexemeId - The ID of the lexeme that corresponds to this tag.
label - The name of the tag (the one that will be displayed).
textXCoord - The X coordinate for the centre of the tag text.
textYCoord - The Y coordinate for the centre of the tag text.
imgXCoord - The X coordinate for the spot where the tag indicates.
imgYCoord - The Y coordinate for the spot where the tag indicates.
